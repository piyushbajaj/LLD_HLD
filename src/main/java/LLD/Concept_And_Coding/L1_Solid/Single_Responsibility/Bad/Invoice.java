 * User: piyushbajaj
 * Date: 13/01/23
 * Time: 5:42 pm
 * <p>
 * Reason why this is Bad?
 * 1. Invoice class will get change, if in future GST get introduce here, so calculation logic will get defer.
 * 2. If printing logic gets change, then this class will get change again
 * 3. Save to DB, can also be used for Save to File, so this class will again get impacted
